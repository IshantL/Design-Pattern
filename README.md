# Design-Pattern

1. First we create a small game of cat clicker
  - It have a image of cat 
  - The number of clicks should be displayed.
2. Now the requirement change by the client:
  - The application should display two cats. Each cat includes the cat's name a picture of the cat text showing the number of clicks
  - The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.
  - The number of clicks should increment when each cat picture is clicked.
